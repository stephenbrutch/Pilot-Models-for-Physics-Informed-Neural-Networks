# Pilot-Models-for-Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks
In this we will have the codes/notes related to my research on modeling pilot control using physics informed neural networks

## 1) Overview: Inside each PDF there is:
1.  The link to my google colab code
2.  The architecture for that code
3.  Results/Analysis

## 2) The notes (The notes are listed in chonological order i.e. Notes 1 is the earliest version)
1. Note 1: [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Pilot-Models-for-Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Google%20Colab%20Code%201%20Notes.pdf)

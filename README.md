# Pilot-Models-for-Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks
In this we will have the codes/notes related to my research on modeling pilot control using physics informed neural networks

## 1) The notes (The notes are listed in chonological order i.e. Notes 1 is the earliest version)

4. Notes 4:
   1. This note is split into multiple chapters where each chapter goes over a different version of the model
      1. Code for chapter 1: [click here](https://gist.github.com/stephenbrutch/e2b036c1a5c22db6aa0cf02943a66118). This code isnt perfectly updated but try to follow up until after the training loop portion then after that it is just standard predictions and plot predictions code
